    <p>Front-end development is the development of visual and interactive elements of a website that users interact with
        directly. It's a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where HTML provides the structure, CSS the styling and
        layout, and JavaScript the dynamic behaviour and interactivity.</p>
    <p>The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that
        cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a
        computer system. Typically the code is comprised of one or more programming languages.</p>
